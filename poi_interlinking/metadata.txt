description=This plugin implements and evaluates the proposed LinkGeoML models for POI classification-based interlinking.

about=consider several of the attributes connected to each spatio-textual entity to decide whether two POIs refer to the same physical spatial entity. Specifically, we utilize the following attributes which can be categorized as: (i) spatial, i.e., its coordinates, (ii) textual, i.e., its name and address name and (iii) number, i.e., its address number. For the textual ones, we utilize and adapt the meta-similarity function, called LGM-Sim. Consequently, we utilize the available richer spatial information to derive a set of informative training features to capture domain specificities and, thus, more accurately describe each POI. The proposed method and its derived features are used in various classification models to address the POI interlinking problem. Additionally, we perform a full machine learning workflow that involves the grid-search and cross-validation functionality, based on the scikit-learn toolkit, to optimize and optimally fit each examined model to the data at hand.
